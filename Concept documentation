Serenity Heart Drive by Matthew Roberts (@inertialspacedr)

Concept Developed: 2015-2025 | © Matthew Roberts 2015-2025 Overview:
The Serenity Heart Drive is an early-stage propulsion and braking system concept inspired by a heart shape. 
It features two mirrored teardrop-shaped chambers within a modular, bolt-on chassis. 
Flywheel pucks accelerate simultaneously from the center of each chamber, moving outward along linear rails into curved paths to transfer momentum to the craft.

How It Works:  Design: Two Individual seperate mechanical spring chambers (half-hearts) are angled 45 degrees from each other, with a torsion mechanism compressing springs at the center. 
The chassis has inner gear toothed walls and groove-cut rails (1mm deep) for the pucks trolly to traverse.

Propulsion Mechanism: Flywheel gear pucks, equipped with motors and clutches, start at the base of each chamber near the center. 
Motors spin the flywheels to speed, then clutches engage gears wich then grip with the toothed walls. 
Both pucks launch outward simultaneously pull there way through each side of the heart shaped chassis to the gain a high speed,
Upon entering the curves the momentum from the flywheel pucks tungsten core push the chassis forward via inertia and momentum transfer.

Kickback Cancellation: Simultaneous acceleration from the center aims to balance forces, reducing kickback. 
The modular design and dampeners absorb residual inertia, though full cancellation depends on precise timing and symmetry.

Braking: Flipping the system could use the same paths to decelerate, capturing kinetic energy, similar to regenerative braking in electric vehicles.

Real-World Dynamics and Feasibility:  
Mechanics: The system leverages Newton’s third law (action-reaction) and conservation of momentum. 
Simultaneous puck launches could minimize opposing forces, but friction, gear wear, and motor efficiency pose challenges. 
Real-world tests with materials like aluminum or steel are needed.

Materials: Space or vehicle use requires durable, heat-resistant materials (e.g., titanium or composites) due to vacuum conditions and continuous operation. 
Vent holes (2mm x 12mm) aid heat dissipation, but radiative cooling may be necessary.

Feasibility: This is an experimental concept, not yet viable for practical use. 
Small-scale prototypes (e.g., for robotics or CubeSats) could test the idea, but scaling to vehicles or spacecraft demands rigorous simulation (e.g., using Ansys CFD) and engineering. 
Kickback reduction is promising but unproven without data.

Applications: Potential for low-thrust satellite maneuvers or vehicle acceleration/braking, though it competes with established systems like electric propulsion or reaction wheels. 
Educational projects are a realistic starting point.

Challenges:  Heat management without air cooling.
Ensuring puck synchronization to cancel kickback.
Modular integration with craft, requiring robust bolting and dampening.

Next Steps:  Build a small model with springs and pucks.
Simulate dynamics with free tools (e.g., OpenFOAM).
Seek feedback from engineers or space communities.

Intellectual Property:
This is my original idea. I’m documenting it and may pursue a patent.
